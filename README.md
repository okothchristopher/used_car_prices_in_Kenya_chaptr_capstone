[Project Formulation](https://github.com/okothchristopher/used_car_prices_in_Kenya_chaptr_capstone/blob/main/files/used%20car%20price%20in%20Kenya%20machine%20learning%20project%20.pdf)|This includes stating the problem I am solving that is pricing of cars in a competitive manner to attract buyers and make business sense of the market. Also included is the steps to be taken during the project undertaking|<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-google_docs-81D4FA"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Github-black">|
[Data Sourcing](https://github.com/okothchristopher/used_car_prices_in_Kenya_chaptr_capstone/blob/main/files/used_car_price_estimator_in_kenya.ipynb)| This involves scraping cheki.com website for car listings| <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-green"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-BeautifulSoup-blue"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Requests-red">|
[Data Cleaning](https://github.com/okothchristopher/used_car_prices_in_Kenya_chaptr_capstone/blob/main/files/cars_cheki.R)| From the scraped data the infromation we need is not readily available so we need to extract that information and come up with useful variables |<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-R-navy"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Tidyverse-purple">|
[EDA](https://github.com/okothchristopher/used_car_prices_in_Kenya_chaptr_capstone/blob/main/files/used_car_price_eda.ipynb)|Explored a number of features available in the car dataset and their relationship with price | <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-matplotlib-116C69"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-pandas-116C14"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-plotly-FC3A13"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-56C28E"> <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-matplotlib-116C69"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-sweetviz-116C15">|
[Machine learning](https://github.com/okothchristopher/used_car_prices_in_Kenya_chaptr_capstone/blob/main/files/used_car_prices_ml.ipynb)|Here I have explored Tree based and Linear Regression models and compared their fit on the data :Random forest has outperfromed other models by a significant margin in fitting the data :: From the results , a car's model eg whether it is a toyota,honda or BMW plays a significant role in pricing, the year of manufacture too is a significant price determinant among others. The r squared score of the final tuned model is an impressive .89 which means a significant portion of the variability in the car prices is explained by the model|<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-sklearn-56C2BF"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Regression-5668C2"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-RandomForest-40153D"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-56C28E">|
